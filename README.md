# SQL-Database
Spring Semester of 2022 SQL Database Group Project
Worked 2 other students: Colbin and Bryan

How to run it on Windows:
Make sure you have python3 pip installed on your PC aswell as MySQLConnector (pip install mysql-connector-python)

Download database on MySQLWorkbench and host it localy on your computer.
Edit the part of the code where it says "host = ...", where it is asking for your password and the SQL host info, and put your SQL info in there.

1. Open up CMD (may have to open as admin)
2. Move directory to "exampledatabase4" (may have to be stored in system32 on your end)
3. Write 'TestEnv\Scripts\Activate'
4. Write 'python3 -m flask run'
5. It should work after that!

If it doesn't please let me know!
